Run one of the files to play each respective game

=======================
MyGuess.py
=======================
This program plays a guessing game with the user - where the computer generates a
number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess within 7 attempts
(This is due to binary search). When the user correctly guesses the number,
the program displays the correct guess. However, if the user exceeds
7 attempts the program will quit.


=======================
YourGuess.py
=======================
The user thinks of a number between 1 and 100, the computer displays the guesses,
and the user respond with the clues. The computer should be able to guess the
correct number in no more than 7 attempts. If the user cheats,
the computer quits with an error message.
