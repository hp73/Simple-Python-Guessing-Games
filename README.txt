MyGuess.py
=======================
This program plays a guessing game with the user.  The program
displays a greeting and thinks of a number between 1 and 100.
The user inputs guesses until a guess equals the number. If user's
guess is too large or too small, the computer replies with a hint
to that effect.  When the user guess the number, the program displays
the total number of guesses.
